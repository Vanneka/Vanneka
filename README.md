I'm Vanessa, a Software Developer with a bias for data and machine learning algorithms.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include:

Some of the things I'm currently interested in include
- 🔭 Building machine learning models
- 📉 Creating interesting data visualisation charts

When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll usually find me taking random pictures of scenery, learning different baking recipes on Youtube or trying to knit a scarf for the umpteenth time.
